"""D-215 gate-registry consistency gate (ADR-0029 section 5).

``.github/gate-registry.yaml`` is the human-authored pin registry: for every
governance surface in ``.github/scripts/`` it records the bound class, where that
surface's expectation is derived, which pytest nodes pin it, and any exemption.

Why a checker at all: the registry is only worth something if a NEW gate cannot
be added without being registered. A hand-kept list drifts silently, and a
silently unregistered gate is exactly the "law without teeth" state ADR-0029 was
legislated against. So the bound set is enumerated from a MACHINE source (the
``check_*.py`` glob plus every other script in the directory -- no hand-copied
list, D-215 7) and this checker reports the set difference in both directions.

The rules, mapped to D-215's five red conditions:

  R1 unregistered_bound_object   D-215 (1)  a bound object with no registry entry
  R2 unresolvable_pointer       D-215 (2)+(3) a registered pin node or
                                            expected_source that does not resolve
  R3 stale_registration         D-215 (3)  an entry naming an object that is gone
  R4 gate_class_not_wired       D-212 (2)  bound_class=gate but no workflow runs
                                            it -- veto-power drift: the entry
                                            claims hard-gate standing it does not have
  R5 bad_exemption              D-215 (5)  an exemption with no expires|issue, or
                                            one whose expires date has passed
  R6 zero_pin_guard             D-215 3    a gate/manual_preflight entry with no
                                            pin at all (fail-on-empty, OPA precedent)

On D-215's numbering: the ruling lists "new gate unregistered" as its own
condition, separate from "bound object unregistered". Those are the same set
difference under two names, so this checker implements the difference ONCE and
splits the reporting by whether the object is CI-wired (R4) rather than
manufacturing a duplicate rule to make the count read five. Stating the collapse
is the honest delivery; a rule that re-reports the same fact under a second id
would be ceremony that reads as coverage.

Transition posture (D-215 4): this ships as ``::warning::`` and exits 0 for one
observation period. The flip to hard red is stated in the ``gate-registry
consistency`` step comment in ``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` -- L1 landed, first
normal PR cycle completed on top of it, coverage self-check in the same flip
commit -- and legislated in ADR-0029 section 5. It is deliberately NOT mirrored
into the registry data file: that file is a machine-read index, and a prose
ruling kept in two places is a second source of truth. (An earlier draft of this
docstring pointed at ``governance.warning_to_blocking_flip`` in the registry,
which no such key ever existed under -- caught by the R46 audit. Same class of
defect as the phantom WORKFLOW.md 4.2 citation this repo keeps having to
correct.) Warnings must not become permanent.

Scope honesty (D-215 6): what is checked here is REGISTRATION DISCIPLINE, not
pin effectiveness. A hollow pin passes every rule below and is still not a pin.
That residual is disclosed in the registry file and mitigated elsewhere.

Usage:
    python .github/scripts/check_gate_registry.py            # warn (transition)
    python .github/scripts/check_gate_registry.py --strict   # exit 1 on findings
