"""D-191(1)c two-track polarity corpus measurement (D-190 / T-R42-02).

Manual measurement instrument, NOT a CI gate -- same shape as
check_release_appendix.py (release-preflight item, human-run). It measures;
check_tdqs_disclosure.py is what gates. Run it to reproduce the corpus
evidence quoted in check_tdqs_disclosure.py, and at the 0.6.0 preflight
when D-190(4)/D-189 decide whether negated_only may be promoted warn->hard.

Two tracks, always reported separately (D-191(1)c):

  PRIMARY  the real validation surface, and the only denominator the
           zero-false-rejection judgement uses (D-190 4): each tool declared
           in docs/adr/0028-elements.yaml against its OWN docstring,
           checking only its OWN elements.
  STRESS   diagnostic only: every docstring-bearing function in
           src/maya_mcp_server x every element pattern (cartesian).

Caliber (pinned because the pre-hardening evidence did not pin it, D-191 1c):
the stress corpus is every function/async-function carrying a docstring,
counted per OCCURRENCE -- methods and nested defs included, nothing
de-duplicated. The 264 figure in the 2026-09-30 evidence was a probe
artifact: that probe keyed docstrings by bare function name into a single
dict and silently collapsed 23 same-named functions. Compare like with
like; this script prints the reconciled counts on every run.

Usage:  python .github/scripts/polarity_corpus_probe.py
Exit code is always 0 -- read the numbers, do not gate on it.
