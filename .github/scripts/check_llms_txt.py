"""llms.txt generator + gate (D-207 2).

Why this is a checker and not a document: a hand-written tool inventory is the
third source of truth. The tool set already has two - the @mcp.tool
registrations and pipeline.TOOL_ANNOTATIONS - and a third copy in prose is how a
consumer ends up told a tool exists that was deleted (or the reverse). So the
page is DERIVED from those two and this script is the gate, in the same shape
as the rest of the .github/scripts family.

llms.txt follows the llmstxt.org convention: an H1, a blockquote summary, then
`## section` headings with `- [name](url): description` entries. It is capped at
100 lines (D-207 2): a discovery file that must be paged through has stopped
being a discovery file. `llms-full.txt` is explicitly NOT produced - one file,
one job.

Usage:
    python .github/scripts/check_llms_txt.py --write   # (re)generate llms.txt
    python .github/scripts/check_llms_txt.py            # gate; exit 1 on drift

Drift in either direction is an error: a tool in the code but missing from the
file, an entry in the file that is not a tool, a wrong class label, or a wrong
summary line. The 100-line cap is an error too, not a warning.
