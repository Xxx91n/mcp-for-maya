"""D-175 TDQS disclosure elements static ratchet.

Asserts that required disclosure elements (legislated by ADR-0028 and
cataloged in docs/adr/0028-elements.yaml) are present in the live
tool docstrings across the codebase.

Elements are defined with either:
  - any: list of regex patterns (at least one must match)
  - all: list of literal strings (every string must be present)

D-180: mutation-class existence assertions MUST be polarity-aware \u2014
a statement like "without auto_fix mutations" must not satisfy an
assertion that a mutation exists (S-03 lesion: the old autofix_mutation
assertion was satisfied by the negated sentence and CI went fake-green).
Elements opt in via 'polarity_aware: true'; during the legislated
observation period a match occurring only inside a negation scope is
reported as a warning, not an error.

D-190 hardened the mechanism form (execution-window product, deliberately
not legislated here): the negation scope is the enclosing CLAUSE instead of
a fixed 80-char window, and an element may list the legitimate
negation-form phrases that forgive a cue in 'positive_exemptions'.
Direction limit (D-190 3): polarity_aware belongs only on mutation-class
existence assertions whose pattern set is purely positive \u2014 negation-form
pattern elements stay unguarded and rely on the exemption list instead.
The hardened form passed the live corpus with zero false rejections
(asserted in tests/test_check_tdqs_disclosure.py); warn may be promoted to
hard only after that corpus stays clean, reviewed at the 0.6.0 preflight
(D-189/D-190 4).

Hard-gated in the CI lint job alongside other check scripts.

# PRIMARY surface, the denominator the D-190(4) zero-false-rejection judgement
# uses: each tool against its own docstring and its own elements. The invariant
# is asserted live rather than quoted:
# tests/test_check_tdqs_disclosure.py::test_live_corpus_has_no_polarity_warnings
# pins the guarded set AND requires zero negated-only.
# STRESS surface, diagnostic only: every docstring-bearing function x every
# element pattern. Its surviving negated clauses are correct negative-form
# disclosures on NEGATION-form elements (irreversible / read_only_disclosure /
# no_mutation_no_undo / overwrite_or_persistence_semantics), which carry no
# polarity_aware guard by the direction limit below, so they are never judged.
#
# Caliber note (D-191 1c): the stress denominator counts every function/async
# function carrying a docstring, per OCCURRENCE -- nothing de-duplicated. The
# 264 figure quoted in the pre-hardening evidence was a probe artifact: that
# probe keyed docstrings by bare function name into a single dict and silently
# collapsed same-named functions. Do not compare the two numbers as if they
# were the same corpus.
#
# The narrowed scope trades that FP class for cross-clause false negatives —
# the legislated direction (D-190 1: on a fake-green-prone gate an FN hurts
# less than FP noise).
#
# The boundary set is clause TERMINATORS only. A line wrap is deliberately
# not a boundary: the D-180 lesion sentence wraps in real docstrings, and
# forgiving it would reopen the fake-green hole. A terminator counts only
# when followed by whitespace, so decimals ("0.5.0") and abbreviations
