"""Append-only guard for published README/asset dirs (D-113, D-081).

.github/assets/ is referenced by absolute URLs pinned to main — old
PyPI release descriptions embed them permanently, so a delete, modify,
or rename there degrades historical release pages. This is a
prevent-accident mechanism: pure additions pass; any D/M/R/T change
under the guarded prefix fails the job.

Invocation: check_assets_append_only.py (no args needed in CI)
  Reads environment set by Actions:
    GITHUB_EVENT_NAME  — pull_request | push | anything else
    GITHUB_BASE_REF    — PR target branch (e.g. main)
    GITHUB_SHA         — head sha (falls back to HEAD)
    GUARD_BEFORE       — github.event.before, mapped explicitly in the
                         workflow step (push events only)
  Local/manual default: origin/main...HEAD (three-dot merge-base).

Base resolution (D-113): PR events use merge-base..HEAD three-dot
semantics — checkout needs fetch-depth: 0. push(main) uses
event.before..event.after two-dot (correct for merges and squashes);
an all-zero before (first push of a branch) skips the check.
--no-renames is deliberate: a rename expands to delete+add, so the D
side catches it deterministically instead of relying on the rename
heuristic; the filter still lists M/R/T explicitly.

Escape hatch: a maintainer-aware merge can still land a removal — the
PR body must state the removal and a ledger note records it. The guard
only forces the decision to be visible; it cannot "guarantee" anything
about rendered PyPI pages.
