"""CHANGELOG Fixed-entry field gate (D-230).

Why this exists: every `### Fixed` bullet in scope must carry the two
structured fields `Broken version:` and `fixed version:` with non-empty values
(D-082 7 / D-183 evidence discipline). A Fixed entry that names what it fixed
but not *which version was broken* or *which version ships the fix* is a claim
an auditor cannot verify - the exact wording-drift class the 0.2.0
"manifest-based cache" line was about, applied to the version axis.

SCOPE - existence only, deliberately no value-domain regex:
  * we assert each field is PRESENT on the entry's last line and its value is
    NON-EMPTY;
  * we do NOT validate the value's shape (semver vs `[Unreleased]` literal vs
    prose). That is a semantic judgment for human review, not a machine gate.
    Over-restricting here would make the gate reject legitimate phrasings and
    get deleted - a deleted gate is worse than none.

ENFORCEMENT BOUNDARY (the grandfather register):
  The version-field requirement (D-183) landed at 0.6.0. Releases 0.1.0..0.3.0
  predate it and their Fixed entries carry no such fields - backfilling them
  would mean inventing broken-version facts for fixes made before the rule
  existed, which D-205 forbids (never guess a cause). So the gate enforces
  `[Unreleased]` plus every RELEASED section >= ENFORCED_FROM, and exempts
  earlier sections as a documented baseline boundary - the same pattern as the
  "[0.2.1] is the first compliant section" note for the evidence-pointer rule
  (AGENTS.md, D-082 7). The exemption is a frozen constant, not a per-entry
  waiver list, so it cannot silently grow.

Fold-time note (runbook/CONTRIBUTING): when `[Unreleased]` folds into a release
section, the literal `fixed version: [Unreleased]` is rewritten to that version
number by hand. This gate does not police that rewrite - it is a human step.

Usage:
    python .github/scripts/check_changelog_fixed.py
Exit codes: 0 = every in-scope Fixed entry carries both non-empty fields;
1 = at least one in-scope entry is missing a field or has an empty value.

    The value runs to the FIRST ';' or end-of-line. That boundary is what makes
    an empty value detectable: when both fields share one line (`Broken version:

    into this one's value and report a present-but-empty field as non-empty -
    the exact escape the R48 audit caught. Splitting on ';' (and the fields never
    contain a semicolon themselves) keeps each value bounded.
