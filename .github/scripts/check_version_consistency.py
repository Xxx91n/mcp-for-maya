"""Version-consistency gate (D-207 9).

Four places carry the product version and they drift apart silently:

    pyproject.toml            [project] version
    src/maya_mcp_server/__init__.py   __version__
    CHANGELOG.md              newest RELEASED section header
    llms.txt                  the "generated ... (vX.Y.Z)" field

The failure mode this buys down is not cosmetic. A tag is cut from a commit
whose pyproject says 0.6.0 while the wheel metadata and the __init__ say
something else, or the shipped CHANGELOG names a release that never happened.
D-107 (tag == diff) checks the tag against the tree; this checks the tree
against itself.

THE SERVER.JSON TRIPLE (D-229 2, added R48)
-------------------------------------------
server.json at the repo root is the mcp-publisher registry manifest (its
default read path per D-150 2). Its top-level "version" field must equal
pyproject EXACTLY - it is an in-repo manifest, so asserting it is a legal
push-CI check. What we deliberately do NOT assert is registry-active state or
that PyPI actually has the version (D-164 beta empty-spin prohibition): those
are external facts no push-CI gate may claim. The assertion object is the
manifest text in the tree, nothing beyond it.

THE UNRELEASED TOLERANCE (why this is not a naive equality check)
----------------------------------------------------------------
During normal development pyproject legitimately runs AHEAD of the newest
released CHANGELOG section: you bump the version, then accumulate the work
under [Unreleased] until the release. That state is CORRECT and must not turn
the lint job red - a gate that is always red gets deleted, and a gate that is
deleted is worse than no gate.

So the rule is directional, not symmetric:

    newest released CHANGELOG == pyproject   -> consistent (released state)
    newest released CHANGELOG <  pyproject   -> TOLERATED, warn, and only if
                                                [Unreleased] actually has
                                                content to release
    newest released CHANGELOG >  pyproject   -> ERROR: a released version is
                                                ahead of the package

__init__, llms.txt, and server.json must always equal pyproject exactly. There
is no development state in which those three legitimately differ.

Usage:
    python .github/scripts/check_version_consistency.py
Exit codes: 0 = consistent (possibly in the tolerated unreleased state);
1 = drift.
