"""D-125 monolith line-count ratchet.

``maya_scene_module.py`` is a registered monolith under T-07
strangler discipline: incremental splits happen where fixes touch,
never a big-bang rewrite — and the file must not keep growing
("ratchet" — ADR-0006 family, fifth instance). The frozen budget
file caps each registered file's physical line count:

- count > budget  -> fail the lint job
- count < budget  -> pass, but print a "may be lowered" hint so the
  ratchet keeps closing instead of decaying into a high-water mark
  (the OmniRoute #8584 failure mode: a cap that only blocks but
  never tightens silently licenses growth back up to the line)
- count == budget -> pass

Invocation: check_monolith_budget.py [path-to-budget.json]
  Default: .github/monolith-budget.json relative to the repo root.
Budget file shape: {"<repo-relative path>": <max physical lines>}.
The CI never writes the budget file.
