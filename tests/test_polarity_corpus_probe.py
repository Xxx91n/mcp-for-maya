"""D-203 regression tests: the sample floor counts verdict-bearing labels.

The probe itself is a manual instrument that always exits 0 (see its
docstring), so its arithmetic is pinned HERE instead - otherwise "the floor
holds" is a claim nobody can fail.

What D-203 changed and what would regress if it silently reverted:

  * MIN_ADJUDICABLE is measured over true_negative + forgiven only. Counting
    known_limitation as well would let the corpus reach the floor with
    sentences that cannot move a verdict, since those samples record a
    clause-scope trade the design made on purpose.
  * every guarded element independently needs MIN_TN_PER_ELEMENT true
    negatives, so one element carrying the whole corpus cannot pass.
